termisoc.org 
============

This is the main termisoc.org website. It currently consists of a temporary exec nominations site preparing for the 2011-2012 academic year.

The HTML/CSS is based around [Less Framework](http://lessframework.com/). The design uses features of HTML5 and CSS3, but provides (basic) fallbacks for non-modern browsers. There is a mobile view facilitated through media queries.

Originally designed and coded by [Nick Charlton](http://nickcharlton.net/).
